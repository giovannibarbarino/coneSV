# Computing cone-constrained singular values of matrices

The methods in the repository solve the problem of smallest cone-constrained singular values of the matrix A with respect to the cones $P$ and $Q$: 

$$\min_{u,v} u^TAv \quad \text{ such that } \quad u \in P, \quad v \in Q,\quad  \\\|u\\\|=\\\|v\\\|=1,$$   

where

$$P = \\\{u | u = Gx,\\, x \geq 0\\\}, \qquad Q = \\\{u | u = Hx,\\, x \geq 0\\\}, $$

and the columns of $G$ and $H$ contain the normalized generators of the cones $P$ and $Q$, resp.
